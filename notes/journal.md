Haven't touched this project for a while. Uploading to GitHub to work on it later.

From what I can remember, the last set of issues I was working on were:
- The text summary of emails was a little too verbose. 
- ElevenLabs was too expensive for what I wanted, so I was looking into Google Cloud Text-to-Speech. I wanted to replicate the voices of the NotebookLM podcast. Maybe turn this into a podcast situation where there are two hosts. Kept a couple interesting resources related to this. 

- (TODO) Add references to the email in question in the email sent out, don’t repeat them in the audio summary. 
- (TODO) Mark emails as read, only open emails that haven’t already been read. Make sure it’s opening things from all inboxes 
- (TODO) Ignore emails from bytebytego and huggingface
